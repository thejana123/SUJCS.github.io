                            <h4>Scope</h4>
                            <hr>
                            <p>We are primarily interested in publishing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of
                                tourism, hospitality, environmental management, business management, economics, and
                                community. Nowadays there are millions of people
                                who have grown up with tourism as a major industry, and they go into traditional businesses
                                and reinvent them for this industry. We are facing the emergence of a completely new service
                                based economy in South Asia and the
                                Asia Pacific in general, in which some industries can disappear while others are likely to
                                be dramatically transformed, and yet others dramatically expand. As for the authors, we
                                would like to see papers from researchers
                                with a deep understanding of tourism and hospitality, and its capabilities, who are not
                                afraid of putting forward new bold ideas and discussing them. The pace of change is so high
                                that communities often do not imagine the
                                full extent of all the opportunities offered by this industry. At the same time, even the
                                most advanced and useful industry is sooner or later confronted with the market, its host
                                community and the laws of economics. We
                                see our potential authors as part of a team, which wants to create a better future with the
                                help of the tourism and hospitality
                            </p>
                            <h4>Why choose us?</h4>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Why should they choose us? We must offer not simply a publication in this new journal – we
                                must strive to attract people who are eager to participate in the project, and in the
                                experiment of developing sustainable tourism.
                                We want to create a community around the journal that would help academics and practitioners
                                with finding partners for joint research. At the same time, the journal will be refereed and
                                it will be abstracted and indexed
                                by the main academic databases and search engines as soon as the volume of content and other
                                criteria are met. We thus see our role as providing a platform for research, commentary, and
                                debate of the highest scholarly quality
                                that contributes to the struggle to create a more just and humane world in the Asia Pacific,
                                in which the systematic and continuous exploitation, oppression, and fratricidal struggles
                                that characterize the contemporary
                                sociopolitical order no longer exist, and tourism achieves its full potential.

                                This document is directed towards the launching of a dedicated Tourism and Hospitality
                                Journal by the Department of Tourism Management at Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.
                                This journal will, from the outset, be a peer-reviewed, international journal
                                that concentrates on the range of subject matter within the hospitality and tourism
                                industries in the Asia Pacific Region, but with a solid base in the Sri Lankan experience.
                                The Journal will be published online in the
                                first instance, prior to our successful negotiations with a major publisher. A decision will
                                need to be made with respect to it possibly being open access (a socially responsible fee
                                structure should be considered, with
                                no charge for students, or for book reviews, commentaries and/or reflections of 5000 words
                                or less).

                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                Our journal will call for submissions of papers, commentaries, reflections and photo essays
                                that showcase progressive scholarship about the tourism and hospitality management industry
                                and related fields of study across the Asia Pacific Region, but with
                                a concentration on work sourced from Sri Lanka in the first instance. We will seek
                                full-length articles (normally 5,000 to 10,000 words), as well as shorter comments and
                                arguments (up to 5,000 words) covering research articles,
                                reflections on teaching in this and related fields, project reports, policy briefs, project
                                management plans and more. We will also welcome short research reports (up to 2,500 words)
                                summarizing the theoretical framework,
                                methodology, and preliminary results of research projects that draw on progressive regional
                                research traditions. Finally, we will include, from the start, a Student Showcase. We will
                                invite senior undergrads and graduate
                                students to submit their papers for consideration in this feature section.
                            </p>
    
                            <h4>Who will subscribe to the Journal? </h4>
                            <hr>
                            <p>We initially will seek active subscriptions from all libraries in Sri Lankan Universities and
                                Colleges, and for their departments of tourism and hospitality management. This will be
                                progressively expanded to the South Asia
                                Region, and further afield as our reputation grows.</p>
    
                            <h4> Peer Review Process</h4>
                            <hr>
                            <p>When the first articles start coming in, we will need all the help we can get to review them.
                                These have to be people we can trust to understand the challenges being faced. They need to
                                set the bar high for the first issue,
                                while also appreciating the difficulties of attracting the big names to start-up journals.
                                We should contact people early so that we are ready to go; it should be the responsibility
                                of the Editorial Board to at least initially
                                identify and approach potential reviewers.</p>

                                Need to recruit the initial editorial board from our most interested and flexible colleagues
                                across Sri Lanka and outside, for quality and reputation from the beginning, and to develop
                                a rigorous peer review process. The board is absolutely crucial. Academic
                                journals work on a system of academic capital - therefore we need respected individuals who
                                are willing to sit on the board, even if they are only lending their name and we end up
                                doing most of the legwork. The suggested

                                I think we need to try to limit the

                            <p>Journal rankings, downloads and metrics do ultimately matter, such as the Journal Impact
                                Factor, but not until the Journal is about 7 years old will impact factors start to come
                                into play. Before then we just have to insist
                                that the journal is a properly peer reviewed one.</p>
